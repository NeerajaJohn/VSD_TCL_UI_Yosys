# VSD_TCL_UI_Yosys

## 5 Day workshop by VSD : TCL beginner to advanced training  
This repo is created as part of 5 day workshop on TCL beginner to advanced training, provided by **VSD**(VLSI System Design) by **Kunal Ghosh**. Workshop focussed on creation of a TCL tool box(a user interface) to accept a .csv file as input and return the reprt of the design using Yosys and Opentimer.

The workshop proceeds by following daily subtasks to create the User Interface tool step by step. The works are done in a Virtual Box which came with Open source tools **Yosys Synthesis Suite** and **OpenTimer STA** Tool

  <summary><strong>Day 1: Introduction and VSDSYNTH Toolbox Usage</strong></summary>
  The overall function requirement of the tool we are designing was discussed in this day's workshop. We build a TCL tool box which takes a csv file as an input and gives a timing result  output after running through synthesis and timing tools. The tasks followed for this purpose are given below. I have linked the specific subtasks done throughout the workshop days. 
  
  - ##### Task 1: Create a command (for example, vsdsynth) and pass .csv files from UNIX shell to TCL script
  - [fhgf](Variable-Creation-and-Processing-Constraints-from-CSV)
  - ##### Task 2:Converting all inputs to format [1]and SDC format, then passing them to the synthesis tool Yosys
  - ##### Task 3:Convert format [1] and SDC to format [2] and pass them to the timing tool 'Opentimer'.
